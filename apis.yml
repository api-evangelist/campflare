description: >-
  Integrate availability alerts and outdoor data into your application, for
  free. Currently, the API supports availability alerts for all campgrounds
  found on Campflare, and a small amount of additional campground data. We will
  be expanding functionally of the API greatly in the next couple months. Our
  goal is to become the go-to source of outdoor data.
